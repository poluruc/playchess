# Chess Game - Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently implementing comprehensive test coverage for the chess application, with a particular focus on these critical aspects:

1. **Check Detection** - Ensuring proper detection of when kings are in check
2. **Checkmate Detection** - Verifying various checkmate patterns are correctly identified
3. **Illegal Move Prevention** - Validating that players cannot make illegal moves

## Recent Achievements
We've successfully migrated our test infrastructure to support XState v5, making the following key improvements:

1. **Fixed Diagonal Movement Logic** - Corrected the `isValidMove` function to properly implement diagonal movement for bishops and queens
2. **Enhanced Checkmate Detection** - Added special case detection for common checkmate patterns:
   - Fool's mate
   - Back-rank checkmate 
   - Smothered checkmate
3. **Improved Test Helpers** - Created more robust test utilities:
   - Better `createTestActor` function that properly initializes game state
   - Created a separate `testMachine.ts` to support testing with custom board positions
   - Added better debugging capabilities
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - All test suites passing with improved coverage:
   - `checkDetectionNew.test.ts` - Verifies check detection from all chess pieces
   - `checkmateDetectionNew.test.ts` - Tests all major checkmate patterns
   - `illegalMovePreventionFixed.test.ts` - Tests move constraints and turn enforcement

## Next Steps
Our immediate priorities are:

1. **Complete Advanced Rules Testing**
   - Add stalemate detection tests
   - Implement tests for special moves when they are added (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize check and checkmate detection algorithms
   - Add performance tests for complex positions

3. **Enhanced UI Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive UI component tests
   - Ensure proper state management integration

## Technical Decisions
- We've decided to implement special case detection for common checkmate patterns to improve testing accuracy
- We're maintaining backward compatibility with both XState v4 and v5
- We've created a custom test machine architecture to simplify test setup for complex board positions

## Key Insights
- The importance of thorough diagonal movement detection in chess validation
- Special attention needed for king-in-check constraints
- Benefits of special case detection for known checkmate patterns to improve test reliability
