# Chess Application - Product Context

## Problem Solved
This project aims to provide a functional and interactive digital chess game. It serves as a learning tool for understanding chess rules, a platform for casual play, and a demonstration of modern web technologies for game development.

## How It Works

- **Clear Feedback:** Visual cues for selected pieces, possible moves, check status, and game outcomes.
- **Responsive Gameplay:** Smooth and immediate reaction to user inputs.
- **Accuracy:** Correct implementation of all chess rules.
