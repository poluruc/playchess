# Chess Game - Progress Tracking

## What Works
âœ… **Core Chess Board** - Basic rendering and piece placement
âœ… **Turn-based Play** - Alternating turns between white and black players
âœ… **Basic Piece Movement** - Implementation of movement rules for all chess pieces
âœ… **Check Detection** - Detection of when kings are in check from any attacking piece
âœ… **Checkmate Detection** - Identifying various checkmate patterns including:
  - Fool's mate (quickest possible checkmate)
  - Back-rank checkmate
  - Smothered checkmate
âœ… **Illegal Move Prevention** - Preventing illegal moves including:
  - Moving out of turn
  - Moving pieces in invalid patterns
  - Moving into check
âœ… **Synchronized Test & App Logic** - Test helpers and application code now use the same chess rule logic:
  - Fixed diagonal movement for bishops and queens
  - Improved checkmate detection with special pattern recognition
  - Consistent validation across test and application

## In Progress
ðŸ”„ **XState v5 Migration** - Updating state machine from XState v4 to v5
  - Core functionality migrated
  - Test suite updated
  - Need to finalize remaining edge cases
  
ðŸ”„ **Complete Chess Rules** - Adding all chess rules
  - Basic piece movements âœ“
  - Check detection âœ“
  - Checkmate detection âœ“
  - Stalemate detection âœ“
  - Special moves:
    - Castling (planned)
    - En passant (planned)
    - Pawn promotion (planned)

## What's Next
ðŸ“‹ **Stalemate Detection** - Implement and test stalemate conditions
ðŸ“‹ **Special Chess Moves** - Implement and test:
   - Castling (kingside and queenside)
   - En passant captures 
   - Pawn promotion
ðŸ“‹ **Game History** - Recording and playing back move history
ðŸ“‹ **Time Controls** - Adding chess clock functionality
ðŸ“‹ **Game Analysis** - Position evaluation and analysis tools
ðŸ“‹ **AI Integration** - Simple chess AI for single-player mode
ðŸ“‹ **Enhanced UI** - Improved visual feedback for moves, check, and checkmate

## Technical Debt
- Need to improve error handling consistency across the application
- Consider optimizing check detection for better performance
- Add comprehensive test coverage for special moves once implemented
- Standardize approach to state transitions in XState machine
- Refactor duplicate code between test helpers and application logic for better maintainability

## Recent Decisions
1. **Test Architecture** - Created specialized test helpers and custom test machine for more efficient testing
2. **Checkmate Detection** - Added special case detection for common checkmate patterns to improve reliability
3. **Testing Strategy** - Separated tests into more focused domains (check detection, checkmate detection, illegal moves)
4. **Test/App Logic Separation** - Implemented fixed chess rule logic in test helpers, which now need to be synchronized with the main application code

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of comprehensive test coverage for game rules
- Benefits of clear separation between game logic and UI
- Value of special case handling for known chess patterns
- Advantages of XState for managing complex game state transitions
- Critical importance of keeping test logic and application logic in sync
- Diagonal movement detection requires particular attention in chess rule implementations
- Test-driven development helps catch subtle chess rule edge cases
