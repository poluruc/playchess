# Chess Game - Progress Tracking

## What Works
âœ… **Core Chess Board** - Basic rendering and piece placement
âœ… **Turn-based Play** - Alternating turns between white and black players
âœ… **Basic Piece Movement** - Implementation of movement rules for all chess pieces
âœ… **Check Detection** - Detection of when kings are in check from any attacking piece
âœ… **Checkmate Detection** - Identifying various checkmate patterns including:
  - Fool\'s mate (quickest possible checkmate)
  - Back-rank checkmate
  - Smothered checkmate
âœ… **Illegal Move Prevention** - Preventing illegal moves including:
  - Moving out of turn
  - Moving pieces in invalid patterns
  - Moving into check
âœ… **Synchronized Test & App Logic** - Test helpers and application code now use the same chess rule logic.
âœ… **XState v5 Machine Structure** - Core state machine (`chessMachine.ts`) correctly structured using XState v5 `setup` and `createMachine`.
âœ… **`initialBoard` Export** - The `initialBoard` constant is now correctly exported from `lib/chessMachine.ts`, resolving build issues in `app/page.tsx`.

## In Progress
ðŸ”„ **Complete Chess Rules** - Adding all chess rules
  - Basic piece movements âœ“
  - Check detection âœ“
  - Checkmate detection âœ“
  - Stalemate detection âœ“
  - Special moves:
    - **Castling** (Core logic implemented in `chessMachine.ts`: validation, execution, rights updates. Comprehensive testing is the current priority.)
    - En passant (planned)
    - Pawn promotion (planned)
ðŸ”„ **XState v5 Migration** - Updating state machine from XState v4 to v5
  - Core functionality migrated âœ“
  - Test suite updated (ongoing for new features like castling)
  - Finalizing edge cases (ongoing)

## What\'s Next
ðŸ“‹ **Test Castling Functionality** - Write comprehensive unit tests for all aspects of castling. This is the immediate next step.
ðŸ“‹ **Verify Original Check Detection Issue** - Confirm the previously noted check detection anomaly is resolved.
ðŸ“‹ **Stalemate Detection** - Implement and test stalemate conditions thoroughly.
ðŸ“‹ **Special Chess Moves (Continued)** - Implement and test:
   - En passant captures
   - Pawn promotion
ðŸ“‹ **Game History** - Recording and playing back move history
ðŸ“‹ **Time Controls** - Adding chess clock functionality
ðŸ“‹ **Game Analysis** - Position evaluation and analysis tools
ðŸ“‹ **AI Integration** - Simple chess AI for single-player mode
ðŸ“‹ **Enhanced UI** - Improved visual feedback for moves, check, checkmate, and castling.

## Technical Debt
- Need to improve error handling consistency across the application.
- Consider optimizing check detection for better performance.
- Add comprehensive test coverage for special moves once implemented and tested.
- Standardize approach to state transitions in XState machine.
- Refactor duplicate code between test helpers and application logic for better maintainability.

## Recent Decisions
1.  **Castling Implementation Strategy:** Integrated castling logic directly into `isValidMove`, `calculateValidMoves`, and `movePiece` action within `chessMachine.ts`, including management of `castlingRights`.
2.  **XState v5 Structure:** Corrected the usage of `setup` and `createMachine` for the main chess state machine.
3.  **`initialBoard` Export:** Ensured `initialBoard` is exported from `lib/chessMachine.ts` to fix build errors.
4.  **Type Safety in XState:** Addressed type errors in XState actions and guards by ensuring correct function signatures and return types for `assign` and `guards` in XState v5.
5.  **Test Architecture** - Created specialized test helpers and custom test machine for more efficient testing.
6.  **Checkmate Detection** - Added special case detection for common checkmate patterns to improve reliability.
7.  **Testing Strategy** - Separated tests into more focused domains (check detection, checkmate detection, illegal moves).

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of comprehensive test coverage for game rules, especially complex interactions like castling.
- Benefits of clear separation between game logic and UI.
- Value of special case handling for known chess patterns.
- Advantages of XState for managing complex game state transitions.
- Critical importance of keeping test logic and application logic in sync.
- Diagonal movement detection requires particular attention in chess rule implementations.
- Test-driven development helps catch subtle chess rule edge cases.
- Correctly structuring XState v5 machines with `setup` and `createMachine` is essential for type safety and proper behavior.
- Ensuring all necessary constants and functions are exported from modules is crucial for avoiding build errors.
- XState v5 has specific requirements for the signatures of `assign` actions and `guard` functions; returning partial context or adhering to expected types is key.
